# Passive Game

This was a first play at writing in the functional paradigm, it is a [pixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/) passive game where the bird flys around hitting the edges of the screen and eventualy hitting the sprite, this scores a point and the sprite is placed at a new random position on the stage. Repeat.
